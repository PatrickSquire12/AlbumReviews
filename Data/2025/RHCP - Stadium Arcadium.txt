Red Hot Chili Peppers
Stadium Arcadium
Funk, rock 
Its outrageous how many good songs there are on this album. might be the best chillis album ever? only reason its not 10 because its just a bit too long...the last 8 or so songs i still dont know. but there are just way way too many good songs (charlie, stadium arcadium, hump, shes only 18, slow cheetah, strip my mind, especially in michigan, hey, desecration smile, tell me baby, she looks to me, readymade).
9.5
