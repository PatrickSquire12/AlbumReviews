        <outline text="A couple of good songs here, but definitely not as strong and memorable as some of their other albums. Black Summer is a classic old-school Chilis song, and Here Ever After is a realy nice song too. Other decent ones are Shes a Lover, White Braids and Pillow Chair, Watchu Thinking, Bastards of Light which has a nice chorus Its still got some great guitar and band work like Its Only Natural, and I think the drumming on this album is more like their older iconic stuff. Still overal decent but not one of their most memorable."/>
