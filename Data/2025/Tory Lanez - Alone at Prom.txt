Tory Lanez
Alone at Prom
Pop, 80s Synth Pop
Awesome album. One of those rare ones where almost every track is a banger. The 80s feel is so good, the drums and synths are fantastic. A great one to drive to. Best tracks: Colour Violet, Ballad of a Badman, Lady of Namek, 87 Stingray, Hurt from Mercury
