Folk, Musical
Very interesting folky album. Kind of sounds like a musical the way its written, very orchestral. Really good songs, very well written. Nice gentle voice and great lyrics. A lot of trumpet parts. Really nice writing and singing. Only negative its that its a bit long & can't really remember second half of it much. Good tracks are Palisides Wasp, Man of Mineapolis, Casimir Pulaski Day, Jacksonville, John Wayne Gacey, Come on Feel.
