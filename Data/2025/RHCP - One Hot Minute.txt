Red Hot Chili Peppers
One Hot Minute
Funk, rock
Really good album, much funkier, darker then their more mainstream stuff, more of the spoken/rapping then singing. also a decent album length. some of the best guitar and bass work. aeroplane, my friends, coffee shop, walkabout, falling into grace.
7.5
