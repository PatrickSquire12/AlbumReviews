        <outline text="Cool dancy album, love her cutesy london voice. The actual beats and samples are really good and kind of dreamy. That kind of classic UK club dance/house, even some drum and bass sounds. All the tracks are pretty listenable, and good to put on as kind of nice background house-dancy music and easy to bop/dance to. Illegal, Tonight, Stateside, Romeo."/>
