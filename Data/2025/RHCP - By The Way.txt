Red Hot Chili Peppers
By The Way
Funk, rock
A slightly more chilled album than a lot of their other stuff. Really nice and relaxing to listen to, often when I think of red hot chilli peppers in my head its this sort of sound. Not every track is a complete banger, but the ones that are are some of their most truly iconic tracks - By The Way, Dosed, Zephyr, Can't Stop, Minor Thing, Venice Queen. Cabron is a nice suprise. Midnight has some crazy chord thing. Just standard elite chillis really.
